### Specifics About This Infrastructure

#### Purpose of the Firewalls

**Current Configuration:**
The firewalls are for protecting the network (including web servers) from unwanted and unauthorized users by acting as an intermediary between the internal network and the external network and blocking incoming traffic that matches the aforementioned criteria.

**Improved Explanation:**
The firewalls are designed to protect the network infrastructure, including web servers, from unauthorized access and potential threats. They act as intermediaries between the internal network and external networks, inspecting incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. By blocking unauthorized and suspicious traffic, firewalls help prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and various types of cyberattacks.

#### Purpose of the SSL Certificate

**Current Configuration:**
The SSL certificate is for encrypting the traffic between the web servers and the external network to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) and network sniffers from sniffing the traffic, which could expose valuable information. The SSL certificates ensure privacy, integrity, and identification.

**Improved Explanation:**
The SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is used to encrypt the data transmitted between the web servers and clients, ensuring secure communication. It protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and eavesdropping by encrypting the data, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties. SSL certificates also provide authentication, ensuring that users are connecting to legitimate servers. This encryption ensures the privacy, integrity, and security of sensitive information exchanged over the network.

#### Purpose of the Monitoring Clients

**Current Configuration:**
The monitoring clients are for monitoring the servers and the external network. They analyze the performance and operations of the servers, measure the overall health, and alert the administrators if the servers are not performing as expected. The monitoring tool observes the servers and provides key metrics about the servers' operations to the administrators. It automatically tests the accessibility of the servers, measures response time, and alerts for errors such as corrupt/missing files, security vulnerabilities/violations, and many other issues.

**Improved Explanation:**
Monitoring clients are tools used to continuously monitor the performance, health, and security of servers and the network. They analyze server operations, collect key performance metrics, and provide real-time data to administrators. These tools test server accessibility, measure response times, and detect issues such as corrupt or missing files, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks. By alerting administrators to any anomalies or failures, monitoring clients enable proactive maintenance and swift resolution of issues, ensuring the reliable and efficient operation of the infrastructure.

### Issues With This Infrastructure

#### Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer

**Current Configuration:**
Terminating SSL at the load balancer level would leave the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers unencrypted.

**Improved Explanation:**
Terminating SSL at the load balancer means that the encrypted traffic from clients is decrypted at the load balancer before being sent to the web servers in plain text. This creates a security risk, as the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers is not encrypted, potentially exposing sensitive data to interception within the internal network.

**Solution:**
- Implement end-to-end encryption by using SSL/TLS on both the load balancer and the web servers, ensuring that data remains encrypted throughout its entire journey.

#### Single MySQL Server Issue

**Current Configuration:**
Having one MySQL server is an issue because it is not scalable and can act as a single point of failure for the web infrastructure.

**Improved Explanation:**
Relying on a single MySQL server presents scalability challenges and a significant single point of failure. If the MySQL server fails, it can disrupt all database-dependent operations, leading to potential data loss and service outages.

**Solution:**
- Implement a MySQL database cluster with primary-replica (master-slave) configuration to distribute read and write operations, enhance performance, and provide redundancy.
- Consider using database replication and automatic failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

#### Resource Contention on Servers

**Current Configuration:**
Having servers with all the same components would make the components contend for resources on the server like CPU, Memory, I/O, etc., which can lead to poor performance and also make it difficult to locate the source of the problem. A setup such as this is not easily scalable.

**Improved Explanation:**
Running all components (web server, application server, database) on the same physical server can lead to resource contention for CPU, memory, and I/O, resulting in degraded performance. This configuration also complicates troubleshooting and scalability, as isolating the source of performance issues becomes challenging.

**Solution:**
- Use a distributed architecture where different components run on separate servers or virtual machines, allowing for better resource allocation and management.
- Implement vertical and horizontal scaling strategies to enhance performance and scalability. This can include adding more powerful servers (vertical scaling) or increasing the number of servers (horizontal scaling) as needed.
