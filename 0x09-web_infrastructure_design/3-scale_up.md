### Specifics About This Infrastructure

#### Addition of a Firewall Between Each Server

**Current Configuration:**
The infrastructure includes the addition of a firewall between each server.

**Explanation:**
Adding a firewall between each server enhances security by protecting each server from unwanted and unauthorized access. This approach creates multiple layers of security within the network, ensuring that even if one server is compromised, the others remain protected. Each firewall can be configured to allow only specific types of traffic, based on the role of the server and the necessary communication pathways, thereby minimizing the attack surface.

**Purpose:**
- **Isolation and Protection**: Ensures that each server can only be accessed through authorized and secure channels, reducing the risk of internal threats.
- **Controlled Communication**: Allows for more granular control over the traffic that can pass between servers, enhancing overall network security.

### Issues With This Infrastructure

#### High Maintenance Costs

**Current Configuration:**
Moving each of the major components to its own server leads to high maintenance costs.

**Explanation:**
Separating the major components (e.g., web server, application server, database server) onto individual servers can significantly increase maintenance costs. This approach requires purchasing additional servers, leading to higher capital expenditures. Additionally, the operational costs, such as electricity consumption, cooling, and physical space, also increase. The increased number of servers results in higher complexity for management, monitoring, and maintenance, potentially requiring more IT staff or resources.

**Implications:**
- **Capital Expenditure**: Initial investment needed to purchase additional servers.
- **Operational Expenditure**: Ongoing costs related to electricity, cooling, physical space, and maintenance.
- **Management Complexity**: More servers to manage, monitor, and maintain, which may require additional IT personnel or advanced management tools.

**Solutions:**
- **Virtualization**: Use virtual machines (VMs) to run multiple components on a single physical server while maintaining isolation.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Move to a cloud-based infrastructure, leveraging services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, which offer scalable resources and pay-as-you-go pricing models.
- **Consolidation**: Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to run isolated applications on the same server, reducing the need for physical hardware while maintaining security and performance.
